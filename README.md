K-NN 

Abstract: K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised learning method used for classification purposes.

Dataset: An artificial dataset has been created for testing the KNN classification algorithm where each class consists of instances belonging to a 'hollow' hypersphere or 'shell'

Method: Have implemented the algorithm from scratch without using libraries from scikit. Have also implemented a k-fold cross validation technique from scratch for generation of training and test set


Decision Tree Classifier

Abstract: Decision Tree classifier is a supervised learning method used for classification purposes.

Dataset: An artificial dataset has been created for testing the KNN classification algorithm where each class consists of instances belonging to a 'hollow' hypersphere or 'shell'

Method: Have implemented the algorithm from scratch without using libraries from scikit. Have also implemented a k-fold cross validation technique from scratch for generation of training and test set


Artificial Neural Network

Abstract: A Perceptron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features or business intelligence in the input data

Dataset: An artificial dataset has been created for testing the perceptron models where the idea is to generate sets of k points (one for each class) at random and use the distance from these points to determine the class or the regression target.

Method: Three algorithms have been implemented, (i) Linear perceptron, (ii) Single-Layer perceptron with backpropagation, (iii) Multi-Layer perceptron with backpropagation. I have implemented all the algorithms from scratch without using libraries from scikit
